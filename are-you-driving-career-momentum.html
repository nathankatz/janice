            <h1>Are You Driving Career Momentum? Ask Yourself Three Questions</h1>
            <h6>by janice waterman january 17, 2019</h6>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">With the start of the new year comes new resolutions and plans for the coming year. Often those plans involve your career, as the beginning of a new year is a good time to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/career-autopilot-do-4-things-take-back-drivers-seat-janice-waterman/" class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take a step back</a> and examine where you are and what you have achieved. Are you on the right career path, and if you continue down the same path, will you meet your longer-term professional and financial goals on your timeline?</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">
                <div class="article" style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em>Are you doing everything you can to drive your career momentum?</em></strong></div> We work with clients who ask themselves these very questions and sometimes their answers require a call to action.
            </div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">In a previous survey conducted by Waterman Hurst, 52 CEO and C-level executives were asked, “What has been your biggest career mistake?” 29 answered, “I stayed too long.” Each executive could specify the position, company, or industry that stalled their career growth, either temporarily or permanently.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">A successful career doesn’t just happen. Some top leaders will tell you (and might even believe) that their brilliant careers happened entirely due to luck or by circumstances beyond their control, but when you sit down with these same leaders and talk through their career trajectory, their moves are typically well calculated based upon their environment, their situation and their goals.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2016/06/22/motivation-and-inspiration-your-allies-in-career-success/#479c721b2b95" target="_blank" class="link" rel="noopener">Achieving your dream job</a> or long-term professional goals requires well planned and selective job moves. Your career momentum builds when you make the <em>right</em> moves at the <em>right</em> time. You can also get back on track when you identify mistakes early and course correct quickly.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em>Answering the following three questions will help you to determine if you are driving the career momentum necessary to get where you want to be when you want to be there. </em></strong></div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Are you changing jobs frequently enough?</strong></div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Some studies have shown that CEOs are at their peak performance after 5 years on the job and many C-level executives are at their peak after 3 years. Some top performing companies create deep bench strength by organizing and reorganizing, based upon these assumptions.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">A key component to build career momentum is to not allow yourself to become too settled or complacent in one position, one company or even one market, and make sure you are making job changes, internally or externally, at just the right time to hone your skills, continue learning, and keep a fresh perspective. Which leads us to the next question.</div>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Are you choosing the right jobs?</strong></div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Did your last job change (whether internal or external) include at least four of the following elements?</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Compatible and Highly Capable Team (Boss, Peers, Board, Investors)</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">More Responsibility</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Your Target Industry</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Your Target Company</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Significantly Higher Compensation Package</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">More Advancement/Growth Opportunity</div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">If the answer is “yes,” you are on the right track.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">If the answer is “no,” you are wasting valuable time and you are most likely eroding your value.</div>
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    <div class="article" style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Are you timing your moves well?</strong></div>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">If you know your growth or interest will be limited over the long term in your present company, start executing a job or board search when you are at your peak. Have you just had a year of outstanding growth? Have you turned around a stalled business in the last six months? <strong>Just when it feels great to stay put, you should start to look around to see what else is out there. Launch your search when you are most marketable. Your options could be much better – either internally and externally. </strong></div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Even if you are no longer at your peak, don’t wait until you lose your drive or job satisfaction. Developing great opportunities and making a wise choice takes time and a level head. If you have waited even longer and you are no longer stimulated by your job, you can bet it shows. Take action!</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">And if you have gotten to the point that you need career repair, get expert help to get back on track as soon as possible. Don’t wait too long to act and evaluate all your options; seek help if your agenda is too full or you lack the skills or network to execute a strategic search. Multiple options are critical to taking the <em>right</em> next step.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em>Just like complacency is the enemy of a successful company, complacency is the enemy of your career. </em></strong></div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Waiting for a severance package is never the best option, even if you plan to “retire.” Those planning to retire most successfully look for stimulating next stage opportunities before they officially retire.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Getting fired is not the career drop-off it used to be, but an ambiguous exit can create doubt in the eyes of future employers and impact the quality of your future opportunities.</div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Even at the C-level, many executives are still yearning for an even more successful career, new challenges, new learning, and a higher net worth. It is not too late to start building towards the next step. </strong></div>

            <div class="article" style="font-size: 12pt;">Making the commitment to invest in your career, just as you do in your business and your job, provides both hope as well as a sense of renewed power and even exhilaration. Career momentum feels good and keeps us current and youthful, and driving career momentum requires a commitment to yourself. If you have energy, passion, confidence and a willingness to embrace change, the return on investment will be immeasurable.</div>
