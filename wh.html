            <h1><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></h1>
            <p>"I recognized the need for Waterman Hurst the first time I decided to change jobs. I started my career as an unpaid intern within a fast growing medical technology company and by the time I was ready for a change, I had worked my way up to Chief Administrative Officer at the age of 29. My company had been acquired by a much larger conglomerate and I knew within the first six months that the environment was not a fit. Since I was responsible for the integration of the two companies, I did not have time to conduct a strategic job search, and since I had never looked for a job beyond a cashier role in college, I had no idea how to conduct a search at any level, let alone the C level.</p>

            <p>I tried to find a private and confidential source of expert C-level job search help because I believed that the investment in my career would be worth it. When I looked for help, I found that the best senior executive talent and career consultants all worked for companies, and while they were willing to help me, they had to help as a favor and on the side; they could not take me on as a client. Their services were designed with companies in mind and they were beholden to their corporate clients.</p>
            <p>The career counselors and coaches that worked privately did not have the expertise, networks, nor proven integrity I needed. Given my education and strong interest in careers and career development, as well as my expertise in leadership development and acquisition, I knew that some day, I would start a high level private career services company.</p>
            <p>When I founded Waterman Hurst, I had 12 years as a corporate officer under my belt and had made three company to company moves, changing industries and moving into a #2 operating role within a public company. I understand that expert private and confidential career help during a leadership career can be game changing.</p>
            <p>Waterman Hurstâ€™s mission remains the same today as when I originally founded it in 2000. We provide knowledge, contacts and services to high performing leaders so they may achieve their career and financially related goals. We avoid any conflicts of interest or agenda entanglements by accepting no fees other than the fees paid to us by our senior executive clients.</p>
            <p>Our clients have the flexibility to choose the services they need when they need them, and they have an ongoing trusted source of advice and support throughout their careers." - Janice Waterman</p>
